# Leap Motion Gaming Kiosk
Leap Motion is a device that allows you to control a computer with your hands. It can sense hand, finger and pointable object (brush, pen etc.) movements in a virtual 3D space at over a rate of 200 frames per second with maximum sensitivity. We, as HisarCS, decided to introduce this device to our school by developing several applications and games controlled with Leap Motion. 

## Description

The system has both multiplayer and single player games in it for students to have fun. All games are reachable with a main menu that can be controlled with circular motion of a finger. Gaming system is currently planned to consist of 4 games: Pong, Snake, Flappy Bird and Mole Mash. Pong game is completed while Flappy Bird and Snake are currently in development.  
The code is written in Java using Leap Motion library. The library can be downloaded at [Leap Motion Developers](https://developer.leapmotion.com/)
